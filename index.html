                What is it about Chad that makes him so intelligent? It might have something to do with being from a different planet; believe it or not aliens have a sense of community service similar to humans. Chad’s service is to inform curious people about the United States Naval Academy Computer Science department. This has subsequently made him an expert on the subject of the current classes and professors offered for the Information Technology and Computer Science major. Through the collaborations of a select amount of students and professor advisors. Chad has finally found the platform that he needed to reach our precious underclass. So when you are asking questions please keep that in mind!

              <h2 class="how_title">How It Works</h2>
                <h2 class="how">&emsp;&emsp;
                  Chad has  a lot of work to do when it comes to processing all these questions and  formulating answers, in a language he is still learning. This is where the work of our capstone team came to the rescue; not only did we create a masterful website that’s easy to navigate and interact with. Chad learned a lot from us using the Word2vec library on python to make matching previously learned questions to the current question asked. Chad uses our database within the Naval Academy Midshipmen server to store all the rules and regular expressions taught to him by the capstone team.

The javascript makes seamless transitions and a chat experience that feels almost life like.A sucker for food, don’t let his physique fool you; he loves cooking only to get to the final result of eating.

His efforts have been mainly behind the scenes working on the storing of data and how they relate to each other.

He helped implement the many rules that dictate how chadbot reacts to certain patterns of words. This laborious process took fine tuning via priorities and percentage of matching vectors with Word2Vec. The small amount of time he isn’t working on the project; he does varsity Gymnastics.

He is currently 21st Company Commander on top of growing one of the finest goatees on the yard. One well kept secret: he can make a mean jambalaya.</h2></div>

When he isn’t researching or teaching; he likes to talk about buffalo chicken dip. If you ever get the chance to see him at Pints with Profs make sure to ask him his preferred method of transportation for the dip is it bread or chips???</h2></div>
